        "body": "## New features\r\n\r\n### JWT authentication\r\n[JSON Web Token authentication](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/blob/master/docs/web-token-authentication.md) will help client developers connect to sensenet ECM and work with the content repository in a more secure and flexible way.\r\n\r\n### Packaging improvements\r\n- SQL authentication is supported during installation\r\n- SnAdmin packages support phase-level custom assemblies that are loaded only for the phase that they are defined for.\r\n- New steps: \r\n    - Edit allowed child types (on a content or content type)\r\n\t- IfComponentExists for checking component existence (soft dependency check)\r\n\r\n### NuGet install improvements\r\nWe modularized our NuGet packages to be more flexible: now we have two packages for our components:\r\n- one for web applications, containing content files and web folder material\r\n- a simple, dll-only package for other project types\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- Variable resolution fix in various steps (Export, Index).\r\n- Warning is logged on unknown action instead of throwing an error. This makes OData responses more robust.\r\n- Eliminated several null reference errors when there was no Site content in the system.\r\n- Install logic can deal with existing databases.\r\n- Service action generates a correct url even if the service name starts with a slash.\r\n- Saving the Root content is possible.\r\n- Removed unnecessary custom workspace type references from the User ctd that prevented saving users.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n### Packaging\r\nPackage manifest structure had to be changed to support the new component model of sensenet ECM. \r\n- Every manifest should contain a component Id and optionally a list of dependent components.\r\n- Package type definition has been simplified.\r\n- Old package structure is not supported anymore, manifest files have to be upgraded.\r\nSee the new manifest structure in this article: [SnAdmin](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-admin/blob/master/docs/SnAdmin.md)\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n- Open in Office feature is currently not available ([issue #10](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/10)).\r\n- Windows authentication is currently not available ([issue #69](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/69)).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet ECM from NuGet article](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/blob/master/docs/install-sn-from-nuget.md).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade from previous versions\r\nIf you installed a previous version, please export your custom content **before you get the new version**:\r\n1. export your custom content from the Content Repository (using the export [SnAdmin tool](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/blob/master/docs/snadmin-tools.md))\r\n2. uninstall the previous NuGet package (v7.0.0 beta)\r\n3. install the new package (v7.0.0 beta2)\r\n4. reinstall the whole Services component. This is a clean install that creates a new db. If you want to use the same db name, use the *ForcedReinstall:true* switch when installing.\r\n5. import your custom data\r\n>There is no in-place upgrade for these versions, the new dlls would not work with the old database.",

Please follow the instructions in the [Getting started section](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet#GettingStarted) of the main readme.\r\n\r\n[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SenseNet.Services.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SenseNet.Services)\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\nThere are a couple of known issues with the beta release. We plan to solve these before releasing the stable version:\r\n\r\n- Open in Office feature is [currently not available](/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/10) in the beta release.\r\n- There is a single Services NuGet package that contains _both dlls and install content files_. If you install the package into _multiple projects_, all the install files (e.g. web.config additions) will be added to all those projects. In the future we will publish two different NuGet packages: one containing only dlls and one for install files.",
