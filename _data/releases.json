        "body": "## New features\r\n### Search module\r\nThis is a [major update](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/125) of the platform: we generalized indexing and querying so that the *Lucene* search engine can be refactored later to work as a *service* instead of as a *local index*. In this first phase nothing will actually change architecturally: the index folders will remain in the local web directory as before. But under the hood we decoupled the search module from the repository, which means we will be able to create and deploy a separate search service in the future, without changing the code in the main application.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\nThis version contains **API changes** that *may* break low-level search-related calls. We had to move a few classes to a different namespace (e.g. the base *TextExecutor* class) and a few enumerations too. If you encounter build or type load errors during or after the upgrade, please follow the suggestions in Visual Studio to update those calls or base classes. We do not expect to have many of these, but if you stuck with the upgrade please contact us for help.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- [SmtpClient instances](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/290) are created in a using block so that they got desposed properly to prevent connection leak.\r\n- [Logout action](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/295) can be called without providing the *ultimateLogout* optional parameter.\r\n- [Add initial *See* permission](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/248) for the *Identified Users* group to the Folder content type so that users see the folder creator action on the UI.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet ECM from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).\r\n\r\n## Upgrade from previous version\r\nIf you already have sensenet ECM installed and want an **in-place upgrade** instead of re-creating the database, please run the **upgrade patch** (you'll find it above in the **Assets** list) in your dev, test and live environments to be up to date. The patch is an [SnAdmin](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-admin) package.\r\n\r\n> This is a **major upgrade**, please check out [this article](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2018/03/05/complex-patch) for details about performing a complex upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe patch above is a **cumulative package** that you may execute on versions from 7.0.0 to 7.0.2. This means you **do not have to** upgrade to 7.0.1 or 7.0.2 before executing this one.\r\n\r\n> Note that after executing the patch, you will have to update your sensenet Services **NuGet** packages to the same version. Please check your **connection strings** (web.config and Tools\\SnAdminRuntime.exe.config) after updating the packages, because NuGet may change those values based on the package contents.",

Please follow the instructions in the [Getting started section](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet#GettingStarted) of the main readme.\r\n\r\n[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SenseNet.Services.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SenseNet.Services)\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\nThere are a couple of known issues with the beta release. We plan to solve these before releasing the stable version:\r\n\r\n- Open in Office feature is [currently not available](/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/10) in the beta release.\r\n- There is a single Services NuGet package that contains _both dlls and install content files_. If you install the package into _multiple projects_, all the install files (e.g. web.config additions) will be added to all those projects. In the future we will publish two different NuGet packages: one containing only dlls and one for install files.",
