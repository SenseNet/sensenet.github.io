Please follow the instructions in the [Getting started section](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet#GettingStarted) of the main readme.\r\n\r\n[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SenseNet.Services.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SenseNet.Services)\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\nThere are a couple of known issues with the beta release. We plan to solve these before releasing the stable version:\r\n\r\n- Open in Office feature is [currently not available](/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/10) in the beta release.\r\n- There is a single Services NuGet package that contains _both dlls and install content files_. If you install the package into _multiple projects_, all the install files (e.g. web.config additions) will be added to all those projects. In the future we will publish two different NuGet packages: one containing only dlls and one for install files.",
