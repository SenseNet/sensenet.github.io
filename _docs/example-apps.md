# Example apps

Following ReactJS example apps are a great way to start building a SPA with sensenet. They show how to start a project based on an sensenet repository.

All the following apps are built with the [sn-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/tree/master/examples/sn-react-typescript-boilerplate) which means they contain the following:

- An example React SPA with sensenet repository login, written in Typescript âœ¨
- Jest tests with Enzyme ðŸ‘“
- Preconfigured Webpack build ðŸ§±
- prettier and eslint ðŸ’…
- husky lint & prettier precommit hook âš“

Each example app requires a login for example into one of our demo repositories (username: businesscat, password: businesscat, respositoryurl: https://dev.demo.sensenet.com)
