# Personal Settings

There are several things that you can customize according to your taste on the Admin UI. You can do most of them in the Personal Settings page. You can open your settings by clicking on the gear âš™ icon in the bottom left corner on the drawer.

The settings are stored in a JSON format but you can get some help with the available settings by pressing the **CTRL+SPACE** combo.

## Default, Mobile, Desktop, Tablet

Some settings can depend on the device that you use. You can set different settings for these devices - and a default value that will be applied if you don't provide a setting on device level.

### Theme

You can change between **light** ðŸŒž and **dark** ðŸŒœ theme.

### Content

You can set up a `browseType` - it can be `explorer` (a tree with a content list), `commander` (a two-panel view) or `simple` (just a simple content list, the best for mobile). You can also define a list of `fields` that should be displayed.

### Drawer

You can enable or disable the drawer, change the drawer type (the options are: temporary, permanent or mini-variant) and define a list of preconfigured items to display.

### Command Palette

You can enable or disable the [command palette](/docs/admin-ui-command-palette/) itself and define a `warpQuery` expression that will be added to any command palette query.

## Dashboards

You can customize your dashboards here - There are settings for `globalDefault` (that will be displayed if you haven't entered into a repository) and for `repositoryDefault` (that can be overrided on a repository). These fields can contain a list of widget settings. Each widget should have a `title`, a `widgetType` and some `settings` that depends on the type. They can also have a `minWidth` setting for the minimum width.

You can use some string expressions that will be replaced with the corresponding values in the content or the title. These phrases are: `{currentUserName}`, `{currentRepositoryName}`, and `{currentRepositoryUrl}`

### Markdown widget

This widtet type has only a `content` field in it's settings that is a _markdown content_, the widget will simply display it. You can also use HTML in markdown.

### Updates widget

This widget will check the _current repository's_ version info and compares it with the latest component versions published to [nuget.org](https://nuget.org). It will notify you when updates are available.

### Query widget

You can define a custom query

## Repositories

Your `repositories` are also stored in the personal settings with an `url` and the last user's `loginName`. You can also define a user-firendly `displayName` (that will be displayed as the repository's title instead of the URL) and you can also override the repository's default _dashboard_

## Last used repository

The last used repository's URL is also stored in your settings in the `lastRepository` field.

## language

You can select between the `default` (english) and `hungarian` language with the `language` field.

## Event log size

You can define the size of the event log with the `eventLogSize`. Only the last N entries will be saved.

## logLevel

You can define the entries to log with the `logLevel` field. Only the listed categories will be persisted in your event log.

## Crash reports

You can enable / disable sending crash reprts with `sendLogWithCrashReports`.
