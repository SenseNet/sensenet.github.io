## Packages

### [sensenet: Richtext field](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/richtext-field)
This release contains a few new features and bug fixes to support the sensenet service infrastructure.

#### Features
- You can use [date and time templates](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1458) (today, previous month, etc.) when defining the minimum or maximum values of a date field.
- A new field type, [rich text field](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1463) was added to let client-side editors work more freely. This lets us store richtext values in a more structured way. Frontend developers have the possibility to [expand](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1492) the value of a richtext field (or all of them) using the OData api to have access to the structured and the raw data in one round.

> This version also contains a patch that will upgrade long text fields that were configured to be displayed as rich text to this new field type.

#### Bug fixes
- An incorrect [timeout value](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1462) caused the access token module to throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException.

#### Testing and infrastructure
- We ported many unit and integration tests from the old infrastructure to have a better code coverage.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- We refactored our [data store API](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1387) to work as an instance. This is part of our ongoing effort to make our apis more easy to test and work in a dependency injection environment.
- Now users will get [explicit permission](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1461) on their profile workspace to let them work more freely in that part of the repository.
