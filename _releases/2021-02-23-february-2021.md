## Packages
### [sensenet: Event basics and infrastructure fixes](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/events-and-infrastructure-fixes)

This release contains bug fixes and minor features to support the upcoming service infrastructure.

#### Bug fixes
- Importing in a Linux environment [works correctly](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1294).
- Group membership editing [works correctly](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1291) in case the group contains identities that the modifier does not have permissions for.
- The GetVersionInfo action displayed an [outdated version information](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1298) after multiple patch executions.
- The Content Type system allowed the registration of [incorrectly defined fields](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1292) which led to a broken schema.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- We started working on an [event infrastructure](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1239) that will provide the base of the upcoming [WebHook](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/526) feature.
- It is now possible to [add custom middlewares](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1302) before or after our conditional middlewares when registering sensenet pipeline elements during app start.
- We extended the _Save query_ action with a new [filter field](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1314) to aid the UI with a structured query storage. It is also possible for saved queries to contain template elements (like _@@CurrentDate@@_).
- We [renamed](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1318) the Browse action to Details to clarify its meaning and defined a new [field control](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1319) for the file size field.
