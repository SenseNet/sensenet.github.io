## Packages
### [sensenet Services 7.7.8](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.7.8)

This release is mostly a technical update that takes us closer to a full .Net Core solution. It also contains several bug fixes.

> This release does not require an upgrade patch if you already have the previous version installed: it is enough to update the packages in Visual Studio.

## Features
- CORS: the allowed origin feature is available in sensenet .net core apps ([#834](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/834)).
- Repository file download is available in .net core ([#789](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/789)).
- In-memory repository: it is possible to import content while the repository is running ([#881](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/881)).
- We published the `Storage` project as a standalone nuget package ([#883](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/883)). 

## Bug fixes
- We return the default value if a setting could not be loaded ([#877](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/877)).
- The new .net core user discovery algorithm became more sophisticated (commit 21d4c7e31db4fdfc69c137449b9019525eb1ece1)
