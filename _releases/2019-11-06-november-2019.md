## Packages

### [sensenet Services 7.7.2](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.7.2)

This release is mostly a technical update. We started working on converting the [OData layer](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/734) from .Net Framework to a modern .Net Standard solution. These are only the first steps, the changes can be observed only in source code. The goal is to let new .Net Core projects use our NuGet packages and install sensenet seamlessly - this will come in a future release.

To get this update on an existing repository, you need to execute a patch. Please download it from the assets list and execute it using SnAdmin on your machine first. It will take some time because we will rearrange metadata in the database during the patch.

#### Bug fixes

- [Content Type save through OData](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/668).
