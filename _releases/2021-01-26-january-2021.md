## Packages

### [sensenet: Developer and content management improvements](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/preview-copy-actionparameters)

This release contains bug fixes and minor features to support the upcoming service infrastructure.

#### Bug fixes
- Users with only preview permissions could not access [preview images](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1241).
- [Copy](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1275) and [Move](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1278) operations have been fixed for cases when working in content lists.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- We started to clean up and simplify the built-in [default Content Type definition](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1238) xml.
- Client developers will not see unnecessary OData system [action parameters](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1226) when using the command executor in admin UI.
- Backend developers are able to define [strongly typed enumeration parameters](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1227) for OData actions instead of having to parse strings manually.

#### Testing
- We started to work on a new [integration test](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1214) framework to be able to test our changes more quickly and reliably.
