## Packages
### [sensenet automatic patching](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/auto-patch-v1)

This release contains new features, bug fixes and package additions to support the upcoming service infrastructure.

#### Automatic patching
The first elements of the new in-memory [patching API](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1067) is published in this release. It lets us [import content items from an embedded resource package](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1069) or [edit string resources and CTDs](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1105).

From now on you do not have to re-create the database every time we add or change content in the main repository - just get the latest packages from NuGet. Those packages will contain the necessary automatic patches for your repository. Patches will run on application start and store the results in the database. You will be able to see the currently installed components and executed packages using the `GetVersionInfo` action.

#### Bug fixes
- Several OData actions return a [real value](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1050) instead of null from now on.
- The old script-style CTD [default values](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/812) (unavailable in .Net Core) are replaced by the usual template variables used in Content Queries.
- Client schema is [reset correctly](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/914) after a string resource change.
- Added more [user-friendly error messages](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1082) for CTD field management issues.
- Added [missing](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/889) [string resources](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/857) for display names for the admin UI.
- [Downloading](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1063) [a file](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1103) with special characters in its name works correctly.
- Binary field metadata [does not break the response](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1091) if the file content is not yet finalized (uploaded fully).
- Added the [correct Owner permissions](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/892) to the Localization folder so that users can manage string resources.
- We changed the default value of the [Url field](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/853) to be `https` instead of `http`.
- [Disabled users](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/856) could log in temporarily.
- Roles fields are [hidden](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/962) from the browse view of groups, membership should be edited on the dedicated UI.
