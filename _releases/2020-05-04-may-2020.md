## Packages

### [sensenet Services Wopi for .Net Core](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.7.9-wopi)

This release takes us closer to a full .Net Core solution. It also contains several bug fixes.

#### Features
- We ported the [WOPI (Office Online Server)](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/759) feature to .Net Core.
- Added the new [ClientApplication](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/785) type to let frontend developers add client-side actions that do not have a server-side method.

#### Bug fixes
- Fixed the Office Online [editing issue](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/584) that prevented other users see changes made in the editor.
- In the .Net Core version the Versioning and approving actions were [not filtered by status](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/955).
- Upload works for content types in the .Net Core version.

### [sensenet Client for .Net 2.0.5](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.0.5)

This is a minor release containing a number of under-the-hood features and a few new APIs.

#### Features
- in developer mode it is possible to trust all or some server certificates
- added several new  APIs that make sending OData requests easier
- old web request APIs that used `HttpWebRequest` became obsolete

### [sensenet Search Lucene29 Centralized 1.3.2](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-search-lucene29/releases/tag/v7.4.1-centralized-grpc)

In this release we are introducing an experimental client (and service host) for the Centralized Search Service that uses the *gRPC* technology instead of WCF. This is a step toward hosting the search service in a more modern containerized environment.

### [sensenet Preview Controller 7.2](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-preview/releases/tag/v7.2-controller)

This is a technical release for supporting the latest sensenet packages and making a few steps toward a .Net Core-compatible preview package.
