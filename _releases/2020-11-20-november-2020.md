## Packages

### [sensenet: Field registration and binary improvements](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/ctd-fields-binaries)

This release contains new features and bug fixes to support the upcoming service infrastructure.

#### Features
- Improved [admin and group protection](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1162): it is not possible to lock out ourselves from the repository anymore by deleting the last admin, or disabling certain users.

#### OData improvements
- We consolidated [empty return values](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1195) of OData methods.
- [Role fields](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1198) threw an exception when dealing with unaccessible roles. 

#### Bug fixes
- [Unknown property](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client/issues/913) error after adding a new field to the CTD.
- Uploading an existing file threw error in [some cases](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client/issues/900).
- We handle well-known [field name registration](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1205) correctly to provide a more meaningful error message.
- Auto-patch fix: an installer will run [only once](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1174), even if there is a faulty patch in the db.
- Removed default value from [birthday field](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client/issues/1043) of users to prevent UI date value confusion.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- The _ModifiedBy_ field became hidden by default to avoid UI clutter.
- It is possible to configure the system to delete binaries [immediately](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1168) instead of relying on a background job.

### [sensenet Client for .Net 2.0.9](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.0.9)
This is a minor release containing a feature related to access tokens.

#### Features
- From now on it is possible to provide the [client id](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client-dotnet/issues/51) along the secret when requesting an auth token.
