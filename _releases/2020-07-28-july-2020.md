## Breaking changes
We had to [refactor](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1009) a couple of our namespaces to be consistent with the industry standard Dependency Injection namespace. All of our DI extension methods were moved to the `SenseNet.Extensions.DependencyInjection` namespace. If you encounter build errors, please add a `using` statement for this new namespace to your code.

## Packages

### [sensenet Tools 3.2.4](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/releases/tag/v3.2.4)
This release contains namespace changes related to the Dependency Injection namespace naming convention.

### [sensenet Limiters and Content protectors](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/limiters)
This release contains some new features and package additions to support the upcoming service infrastructure.

#### New features
- Added [new fields](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1006) to the User and Group types to expose role membership.
- From now on there are [protected content items](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/946) in the repository that cannot be deleted or moved. This will prevent users accidentally deleting system content. The default list is extendable through configuration.
- The new [response size limiter](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1008) feature is able to prevent clients downloading a huge amount of data.

#### Bug fixes
- The [QUICK query keyword](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1015) was not parsed and handled correctly.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- Added a few [content items](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1002) to the default package that will be used by all installations.

### [Lucene search Dependency Injection namespace changes](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-search-lucene29/releases/tag/di-namespace)
This release contains a bug fix and also follows the namespace changes in the core product.

#### Bug fixes
- It is possible for app developers using the centralized index to [set the index directory path](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-search-lucene29/issues/37) directly instead of relying on a default algorithm for selecting the path.

### [sensenet TaskManagement Core v2.1.0](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-taskmanagement/releases/tag/taskman-netcore-prepare)
