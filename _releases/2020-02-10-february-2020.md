## Packages
### [sensenet Services 7.7.7](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.7.7)

This release is mostly a technical update that takes us closer to a full .Net Core solution. It also contains several bug fixes.

> This release does not require an upgrade patch if you already have the previous version installed: it is enough to update the packages in Visual Studio.

#### Features
- The new .Net Core OData layer is able to handle [querystring parameters](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/838) 

#### Bug fixes
- Use async stream operations in [OData middleware](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/860) because that is the default in .net core to prevent a runtime exception.
- Fix empty query [execution](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/861).
- Allowed child types field is [indexed correctly](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/333) and became searchable.
- Previous [GetSchema changes](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/843) (added content handler info) were ported to the old Services project.
- OData middleware is [registered correctly](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/859) and developers may add custom middleware after it correctly in a .net core web project.
- Users without admin permissions are able to create other users [correctly](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/510).

#### Installation
To get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).

### [sensenet Client for .Net 2.0.3](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.0.3)
This is a minor release containing only a bug fix related to using the client in a web environment.

#### Bug fixes
- ODataRequest works with a [local server variable](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/issues/32).

#### Binaries

### [sensenet Tools 3.2.1](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/releases/tag/v3.2.1)
This is a minor release containing only a few changes. We have changed the default tracer to write to the _trace_ instead of the file system so that developers do not have to deal with file system issues during installation.

#### Bug fixes
- writing log files to the file system has become [more robust](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/862).

#### Binaries
If you want to reference this library in your project, please do it by installing the NuGet package.
