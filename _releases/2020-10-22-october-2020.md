## Packages
### [sensenet: Enhanced automatic patching](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/auto-patch-v2)

This release contains new features and bug fixes to support the upcoming service infrastructure.

#### Enhanced automatic patching
We added the second set of features to the automatic [patching infrastructure](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/361): developers are able to execute patch operations [before and after](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1068) the repository has started. This makes it possible to install or patch features that require database changes.

We also made sure that patches run [exclusively](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1065), even if there are other app domain (re)starting in the environment at the same time.

#### OData features
- We added the original path info to the [Move and Copy batch](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1161) OData actions so that the client can manage the UI after the operations.
- The field information returned by the GetSchema action contains [enum names](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1150) instead of their integer representation.

#### Bug fixes
- It is possible to override the [default client parameters](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1169) in configuration.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- We are working towards an enterprise [loggin infrastructure](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1027). Registering the necessary [ILogger types](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1151) is the first step.
- Audit event writer is [configurable](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1167) so that an empty audit writer can be set in certain applications to keep the database log smaller.

### [sensenet Tools 3.2.6](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/releases/tag/v3.2.6)

This is a minor release containing a new extension method for registering our [ILogger wrapper classes](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/pull/54).

### [sensenet Client for .Net 2.0.8](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.0.8)

This is a minor release containing a fix related to reference fields.

#### Bug fix
- The `LoadReference` and `LoadReferences` methods are able to handle [single reference fields](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client-dotnet/issues/47) correctly.
