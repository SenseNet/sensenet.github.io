## Packages
### [sensenet WebHooks](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/webhooks)
This release contains bug fixes to support the upcoming service infrastructure and the new WebHooks feature.

#### Features
- The first version of [WebHooks](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/526) is released! You can start subscribing to events and receive them in a 3rd party service.

#### Bug fixes
- Predication engine is able to run on [Delete events](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1328) correctly.
- Removed `http` (non-secure) support from the [WOPI feature](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1344). We support `https`-only connections from now on.
- [Workspace name length](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1350) was too restrictive, it is possible to create workspaces with names up to a 100 characters from now on.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- We extended the [DB usage](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1320) informatin provided by the repository.
- We started to work on modernizing our [data layers](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1244) to use the .Net dependency injection infrastructure.
- Field ordering and visibility has been rearranged in [several built-in CTDs](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1338) to make the UI more straightforward.
