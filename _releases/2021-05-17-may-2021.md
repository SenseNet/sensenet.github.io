### [sensenet: Deleted events and new configuration possibilities](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/deleted-events)
This release contains a few new features and many bug fixes to support the sensenet service infrastructure.

#### Features
- We consolidated [Deleted content events](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1250). Move is not fired anymore when deleting to the Trash, and Delete/DeletePhysical events are fired when appropriate.
- Added new field configuration for setting the [minimum and maximum value](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1446) for a DateTime field.

#### Bug fixes
- Several string resource identifiers appeared on the UI after creating a new resource content. We [fixed this](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/474) by restarting the string resource handler on the backend when necessary.
- There was an `EntityNotFoundException` when editing [member list of a group](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1424) containing nonexisting member ids.
- We hid the unnecessary field [Owner when visitor](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1428) from the UI to avoid confusion.
- There was a [typo](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1434) in the GetVersionInfo action response.
- We added a new [identifier to OData operations](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client/issues/1307) so that the client can tell apart different actions that have the same name.
- OData `expand` works correctly for [see-only content items](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1443) and available head-only fields.
- Removed some old and unnecessary APIs related to [NodeType creation](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1448).

#### Testing and infrastructure
- We moved many of our old [MS SQL](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1220), [AccessToken](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1370) and [FieldIndexHandler](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1374) tests to the new test infrastructure.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- Now it is possible to [trigger a webhook manually](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1409) for testing purposes.
- We are working on modernizing our backend classes to work with dependency injection. This time we added new ways to register the [security data provider](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1438) and to configure [connection strings](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1385).

### [sensenet Tools 3.2.7](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/releases/tag/v3.2.7)
This is a minor release containing a new extension method for setting the [global configuration instance](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/pull/56) earlier.

### [Security data providers in service containers](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-security/releases/tag/security-dp-di)
This release contains under-the-hood refactors and a couple of improvements. 

#### Features
- From now on both EF6 and EFC security data providers can be used with [dependency injection](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1438).
- InMemory data provider can be used as an [instance](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-security/issues/37).
