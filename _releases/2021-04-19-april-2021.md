## Packages

### [WebHook payload and blob test infrastructure](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/webhook-payload-and-blobtests)

This release contains a new WebHook feature and several internal features and bug fixes to support the sensenet service infrastructure.

#### Features
- Our WebHook module is now able to send a [custom payload](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1402) when a webhook is triggered. This lets developers connect to already existing 3rd party services.

#### Bug fixes
- We consolidated many of our built-in content type [icon names](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1360) so that the frontend can use a unified icon set.
- The Type field value was [missing](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1388) from the OData response in some cases.

#### Testing and infrastructure
- We are in the middle of moving our old tests to the new API that is able to handle integration tests in a unified way. In this release we moved our [blob tests](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1218) to the new test project.
- We improved [reference property handling](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1317) in our in-memory database so that tests can work in a unified way.
- Added [caching for index documents](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1242) so that the document is generated only once when needed.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- To aid our admin UI dashboard, we added more information to the [version info](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1297) action result.
- We are working on modernizing our backend classes to work with dependency injection. This time we refactored our [binary layer](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1359) to work with instances instead of a static API.
- Added a new logger option during [patching](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1287) to let us collect more detailed messages during patching.

### [sensenet Client for .Net 2.0.11](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.0.11)

This is a minor release containing a small fix and a new content property.

#### Features
- We added a new [FieldNames](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client-dotnet/issues/56) property to the Content class to have a list of field names found in the response.

#### Bug fixes
- Removed a [JObject restriction](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/commit/e907db389066b761012537238ef4fb2c4edd22f5) when deserializing a response to let the caller work with JArrays too.
