## Packages

### [sensenet Tools 3.2.5](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/releases/tag/v3.2.5)

This release contains a couple of features that will help testing and using the official `ILogger` interface in .Net Core.

#### Features
- The [object accessor](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/pull/51) API lets developers work with static members and inherited types.
- The new [logger implementation](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/issues/53) will let app developers connect the `ILogger` API with the sensenet logging API.

### [sensenet Client for .Net 2.0.7](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.0.7)
This is a minor release containing an initial version of the new Token Store API.

#### Features
- The new [Token Store](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/issues/43) API helps developers with requesting and storing access tokens.

### [sensenet application start and OData improvements](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/appstart-odata-upload)

This release contains new features, bug fixes and package additions to support the upcoming service infrastructure.

#### New OData features
- The new [GetAcl](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1017) action returns the information necessary for the client to manage permission settings.
- Our OData API has the ability to [filter actions](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/852) similarly to content collections. This will help reduce the response size.
- Some of our actions now return a [JSON response](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/1051) instead of a null value to let the client handle the response correctly.

#### Backend improvements
- We ported the old [Membership Extender](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1023) feature to the .Net Core environment.
- We started to refactor our [test projects](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/919) to .Net Core to make tests run faster and be more flexible.
- We started working on modernizing the [application start](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1048) API to work seamlessly with the new .Net Core dependency injection infrastructure.

#### Bug fixes
- [Uploading a CTD](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1036) is now possible: the backend recognizes the correct parent type from the provided xml.
- [Download](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client/issues/717) is fixed on localhost sites by modifying cookie settings.
- The [maintenance log](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/1033) was flooded with trace messages, because of incorrect type load.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- When a user registers to the repository using an external provider (e.g. GitHub or Google) their [avatar is saved](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/962) to the repository.
- Several content field defaults, allowed child types and localization values have changed to support the service admin UI.

### [sensenet TaskManagement Core v2.2](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-taskmanagement/releases/tag/taskman-netcore-2.2)

In this release we updated the core Task Management library to modernize the task manager API and continued to upgrade the web and agent projects to work in a .Net Core environment.

### [sensenet Preview Controller 7.3.2](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-preview/releases/tag/di-change)
This is a technical release to support the latest sensenet packages.

### [sensenet Aspose Preview provider 7.3.2](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-preview-aspose/releases/tag/v7.3.2)
This release follows the changes in the core product. In an existing application please update the NuGet package to get the latest version.
