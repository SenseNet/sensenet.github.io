## Packages

### [sensenet Services 7.6.3](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.6.3)

There are mostly bug fixes in this release, please take a look at the following list of changes.

#### Client changes
- As part of a cleanup we [refactored](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/pull/652) the generated [TypeScript schema](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client/issues/32).

#### Bug fixes
- Office Online actions take [action type](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/627) (e.g. edit or view) into account when serving WOPI actions to the client. This is important in cases when a file (e.g. a doc file) can be viewed but not edited.
- From now on it is possible to define [allowed origin domains](https://community.sensenet.com/docs/cors/) with a [port number](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/258).

#### Package changes to support .Net Standard
- We removed `ConfigurationManager` usages from the ContentRepository and Storage projects to support .Net Core applications.

#### Installation
To get started please follow the instructions in the [Install sensenet from NuGet article](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/install-sn-from-nuget).
