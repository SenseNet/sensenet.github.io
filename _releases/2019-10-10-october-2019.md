## Packages

### [sensenet Services 7.7.1](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.7.1)

This release marks a major milestone for the sensenet Content Repository. We refactored our data storage layer to meet the requirements of other (non-relational) data storage platforms and modern programming patterns (e.g. async data access).

To get this update on an existing repository, you need to execute a patch. Please download it from the assets list and execute it using SnAdmin on your machine first. It will take some time because we will rearrange metadata in the database during the patch.

#### Features
- [New Data Storage API](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/556)
- [Most important APIs are extended with async overloads](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/658)
