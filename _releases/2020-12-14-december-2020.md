## Packages

### [sensenet: Public admin and user registration improvements](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/publicadmin-registration)

This release contains bug fixes and minor features to support the upcoming service infrastructure.

#### Bug fixes
- Fixed a [datetime minvalue](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1206) issue by using the built-in .Net datetime minvalue instead of the old SQL value, which was too restrictive.
- From now on we save [longtext values in unicode format](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1149) to prevent loosing some characters.
- When an OData post contained certain special characters (the '=' or '&' sign for example), the server [parsed it incorrectly](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client-dotnet/issues/50).
- A protected group's initial import runs correctly, even if there are no real users in the group yet.

#### sensenet as a service improvements
- We added a new [public admin user](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1156) to let customers create different types of clients that work with the repository.
- When users [register to SNaaS](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/1156) using their external accounts (Google or GitHub) and we already have the user in the system, we'll simply merge these accounts.

### [sensenet Client for .Net 2.0.10](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.0.10)

This is a minor release containing new tests and a consolidated token interface.

#### Features
- We consolidated the [token store and token provider](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client-dotnet/issues/55) interfaces to be more consistent.
- We added more tests and logs related to authentication and url handling.
