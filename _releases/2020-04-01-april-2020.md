## Packages
### [sensenet ContentRepository 7.7.9 and Services.Core 0.0.7](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.7.9)

This release is mostly a technical update that takes us closer to a full .Net Core solution. It also contains several bug fixes.

> If you have the .Net Framework version of sensenet installed, this release does not require an upgrade patch: it is enough to update the packages in Visual Studio.

#### Features
- Added a new action and infrastructure for [registering users](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/895) using external providers.
- Our authentication middleware accepts identifiers in the [client_sub](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/905) claim as well along with the original `sub` claim.
- Secure [file download](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/889) feature has been implemented in the .Net Core Services layer.
- The in-memory blob provider (for testing purpuses) is able to handle [chunk file upload](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/915) requests.

##### OData improvements
- The OData middleware understands [form-encoded](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/907) request parameters.
- We ported the following actions to the new .Net Core Services layer:
   - [Upload action](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/903)
   - [Delete action](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/892)

#### Bug fixes
- Typescript metadata response contained a [duplicate Type property](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/887).
- Typescript metadata `HandlerName` was [missing from the schema](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/888).
- OData operations `HasPermission` and `GetPermission` [became ODataFunctions](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/896) (so that they can be called using a `GET` request).

### [sensenet Tools 3.2.2](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-tools/releases/tag/v3.2.2)

This is a minor release containing only a bug fix related to OS-independent file path handling.

#### Bug fixes
- [DirectoryNotFoundException](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-tools/issues/44) was thrown in Linux-based invironments.

### [SenseNet.Search.Lucene29.Centralized 1.3.1](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-search-lucene29/releases/tag/v7.4.0-centralized)

In this minor release we added an option to the Centralized search engine to configure WCF binding through code.

### [sensenet Client for .Net 2.0.4](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.0.4)

This is a minor release containing only a small api expansion related to server definition.

#### Bug fixes
- [Incorrect Server parameter handling](https://github.com/sensenet/sn-client-dotnet/issues/35) has been fixed.
