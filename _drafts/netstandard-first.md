## A unified .net platform
There is a lot going on with .Net these days. First came the new era of .Net Core, then a new standard emerged that serves as a bridge between the old and the new platforms. We have to make sensenet available to as many customers as it is possible. This is why we started to unify our projects to support .Net Standard 2.0 that contains a lot more apis than its predecessors.

To make this possible, we have to upgrade all our libraries to at least .Net Framework 4.6.1, because that is the oldest version on the framework line that supports .Net Standard 2.0. This already happened in the last few days: we released a new version of our components containing the new libraries.

> That was the easy part.
