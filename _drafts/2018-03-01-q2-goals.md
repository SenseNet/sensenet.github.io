### sensenet ECM UX research and desing

After so many under the hood changes like the componentization, as one of the biggest upgrade in SN7, the user interface will get an overhaul as well. 
We want to create a UI which is future proof and amazig to use, so we started working with a UX researcher who are contacting our partners to collect as much feedback as he can directly from you, our users.

After this initial research phase, the design process will start with numerous wireframes and plans for the revamped user interface.

We want to understand how people really use sensenet and make it more simple and easy to use, so you’ll find every button, controls and other elements at the right place, you won’t need to serch for them.

Stay tuned because we’ll share more info about the new sensenet UI in the coming months.
