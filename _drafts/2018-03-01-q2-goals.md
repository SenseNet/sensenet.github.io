### Cloud compatibility
The next milestone in the lifetime of SN7 is cloud compatibility which involves lot of additional researches and developments. 

Read below some challenges we will be working on in Q2:

#### Azure SQL & AD
You can already use Azure SQL to host sensenet’s database but the installer does not support Azure Active Directory authentication yet so you’ll need to use SQL authentication during the install process.

#### Messaging and cache
We will start working on refactoring messaging and caching in sensenet by examining the industry standard and implementation opportunities. During the first phase we’ll create a study from the current state and opportunities, then we can move on by forming needs and actions for future improvements to modernize messaging and caching. As cloud compatibility is already in the corner, sensenet messaging in cloud environment is also a hot topic in our product team.

#### Disk usage
Like messaging and caching, disk usage is a bit different in a cloud environment than on premise that's why we will research how Azure operations affect our disk usage.


### sensenet UX revamp

After so many under the hood changes like the componentization, as one of the biggest upgrade in SN7, the user interface will get an overhaul as well. 
We want to create a UI which is future proof and amazig to use, so we started working with a UX researcher who are contacting our partners to collect as much feedback as he can directly from you, our users.

After this initial research phase, the design process will start with numerous wireframes and plans for the revamped user interface.

We want to understand how people really use sensenet and make it more simple and easy to understand, so you’ll find every button, controls and other elements at the right place, you won’t need to serch for them.

Stay tuned because we’ll share more info about the new sensenet UI in the coming months.


### DMS v2.0
In Q2 we will publish the 2.0 version of our document management system which is started back in 2017 as a DMS MVP project. Now we want to go further by implementing the following features into the 2.0 version:
- Copy and Move action
- Improved path picker
- Real time document editing

Check out the current state of the DMS right [here](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-dms-demo).



### Admin GUI v0.1

### Dynamic Content Type editing in SN7

### Standalon DocViewer

DocViewer is part of the preview component 

Future: Standalone docviewer which can be used with any preview generator


### Office Web Apps Server integration

“Office Web Apps Server is a new Office server product that delivers browser-based versions of Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote. A single Office Web Apps Server farm can support users who access Office files through SharePoint 2013, Lync Server 2013, shared folders, and websites. The new stand-alone deployment model means that you can manage updates to your Office Web Apps Server farm independently of other Office Server products that are deployed in your organization.”

### More training materials and tutorials
As we promised we are working constantly on training materials. 
In Q1 we published our first video tutorial of the SN7 era and we constantly migrating articles from our wiki site to the new community site. In most cases some modification is needed, so we review and update all articles before posting them to community site. Check all updated and new docs on our community site.
