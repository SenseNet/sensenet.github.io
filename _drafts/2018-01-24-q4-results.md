Last year was quite busy in Sense/Net. The main goal of the core team was to publish sensenet 7 stable release, and create as many documentation, tutorial and sample one page apps (like DMS) to improve the product by using it and to present the new view coming with sensenet 7.
Also lots of imporovements have been done concerning the product, for exemaple in IR and batch actions to name a few.

We want to help you to start building your own solution with sensenet 7, so let us summarize what we achieved in 2017.

## sensenet 7 stable release

One of the biggest milestone of last year was [sensenet 7 stable release](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2017/12/06/release-7.0-stable) back in december. With the new version, the core source code did not changed much, but SN 7 introduces a new, [componentized era](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2017/09/27/new-sn7-components), by slicing up the product to building blocks or components.
After four beta releases we introduced the stable sensenet 7 release. After that, we will publish patches for SN 7 so you can already start working on new projects using the new version, we have your back.


## Componentization

As mentioned before, SN 7 is no more one huge software, it is built up of different components which can be added to the core Services component based on your own needs.
Once this core layer, mother of all components is installed in your project, you can already start working on your solution but we have some really useful components to help you out.

- [Workflows](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/76) are a great tool for building business processes involving content creation and response to human interactions (approving a document, completing a task or clicking on a link in a mail).

- [Notification](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/77) is a feature for users who want to be informed about Content changes in the system. Users can subscribe to notifications on possible changes to Content items.

## DMS MVP

We think the best way to develop and improve a product is by using it.
That's why we decided to create a [document management system MVP](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-dms-demo) using sensenet 7 as content repository and write a one page app using React. Feel free to clone the solution, study the code or even use or improve it.

The feature set of the DMS MVP were the following:
- login
- registration
- basic document library
- basic document management functionalities (create, copy, move)
- upload


## IR Decoupling

We started working on re-architecting our [Information Retrieval](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/issues/125) module that consists of two important features of an ECM solution: indexing and querying. Previously the exclusive tool used for this was Lucene.NET with a local index folder. That is a problem in a cloud environment where you cannot rely on having local indexes on the web server. So we decided to decouple Lucene-related indexing and querying operations from the main product and generalize the whole feature.

Now we are close to finalizing the first step: making the IR module replaceable. This will let us create a new search engine for cloud environments that will work as a service. Stay tuned for news on this very soon!


## Batch action improvements

We have done some improvements which will make your life better when copying, moving or deleting multiple files. From now, in case of failure, the process will return with detailed information about each problematic files, giving you some hint about the cause of the issue.
Use and test it, and feel free to give us feedback.

## OAuth

OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. In sensenet ECM we use it as an extension to our JWT authentication to let users authenticate using well-known services (such as Google or Facebook). The benefit is that users are able to sign in to a sensenet ECM application with a single click, without manual registration. Read the [blogpost](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2017/12/20/first-oauth-implementation) to learn more.

Integrate [Google authentication]((https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-oauth-google)) to your own application following our [tutorial](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-auth-google).
In the first iteration we only implemented Google Sing-in, but you can add other services (like Facebook). If you do so, please consider sharing it with the community so that others can use it too!
