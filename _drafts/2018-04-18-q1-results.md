## First sn7 patch
In February the first patch for the sensenet 7 was arrived with several bugfixes and a new feature namely ISnComponent interface for defining components.
At the time of writing the sensenet 7.1.1 version is already out.
Follow releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases) to keep up to date.
Read our [tutorial](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2018/02/14/install-patch) about installing patches in sensenet.


## scoped packages

The whole idea behind scoped packages was to divide overgrown client side packages into smaller ones and publish these new, refactored packages under @sensenet scope.
Simplifying API and get rid of external dependencies like RxJs library were also among our goals when we started this project a few months ago.

Take a look at our new packages and their dependencies:

## release sn7.1
Back in March [sensenet 7.1](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.1.0) was published packed with many under the hood changes. Major changes was made in indexing and querying generalization. All of these modifications are needed to prepare Lucene search engine to work as a service instead of as a local index. In this first phase no changes has been made in architectural level however you may need to rebuild or update some libraries before executing the patch due to some API changes.
Please read our [post](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2018/03/05/complex-patch) to learn more about changes and installation process.
