Q1 was quite successful in terms of the product roadmap. We pubslihed many [tutorials](/tutorials/) and [documentations](/docs/) on our community site to help you start working with sensenet. We decided to publish every feature in both Enterprise and Community Edition of sensenet, and we'we done many improvements in the core service layer and in the components as well. Read our post to learn more about Q1 in sensenet.

## Tutorials
As SN7 opened a whole new way to develop with sensenet, many tutorials are needed to support early birds, who wants to start using these new possibilities.
Now you can work with sensenet using your favourite JS framework or even MVC. At the moment we provide tutorials for MVC and our most preferred JS frameworks.

- [MVC](/docs/tutorials/starting-out-with-mvc/)
- [reactjs](/docs/tutorials/starting-out-with-reactjs/)
- [aurelia](/docs/tutorials/starting-out-with-aurelia/)


## IR Decoupling
We started working on the Information Retrieval module refactoring project back in Q4 last year. This module is responsible of indexing and querying within sensenet.
One of the most important task was to make the IR module replaceable. 

- [lucene search components](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/204)
- [xml documentation](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/207)
- [Cleanup files and finalize project structure](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/185)
- [Search configuration](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/189)

## JWT improvements

In SN7 you have the opportunity to use [JSON Web Tokens](/docs/tutorials/how-to-use-jwt-in-sn-client-js/) to authenticate users. In the last few months we'we made some improvements concerning the JWT Authentication. These changes are the followings:
- Users have option to log out from all devices with a single click
- Password change now triggers a force log out on all devices
- Session is destroyed on logout
- Login extender and audit log works with JWT the same way as with forms auth

## Preview component and AD Sync

In Q1 an important decision was made concerning the Enterprise only features of sensenet, therefore we will publish each and every feature as part of the Community Edition including AD Sync and Preview Component as well.

For that reason the [Preview component](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SenseNet.Preview/) and [AD Sync](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SenseNet.SyncAD2Portal) NuGet packages are available to download and installed to any sensenet 7 solution without having Enterprise licences.

## First SN7 patch
In February the first patch for the sensenet 7 was arrived with several bugfixes and a new feature namely ISnComponent interface for defining components.
At the time of writing the sensenet 7.1.1 version is already out.
Follow releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases) to keep up to date.
Read our [tutorial](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2018/02/14/install-patch) about installing patches in sensenet.


## scoped packages

The whole idea behind scoped packages was to divide overgrown client side packages into smaller ones and publish these new, refactored packages under @sensenet scope.
Simplifying API and get rid of external dependencies like RxJs library were also among our goals when we started this project a few months ago.

Take a look at our new packages and their dependencies:

[Learn more](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2018/02/21/scoped-packages) about what we achieved in Q1 with npm packages.


## release sn7.1
Back in March [sensenet 7.1](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.1.0) was published packed with many under the hood changes. Major changes was made in indexing and querying generalization. All of these modifications are needed to prepare Lucene search engine to work as a service instead of as a local index. In this first phase no changes has been made in architectural level however you may need to rebuild or update some libraries before executing the patch due to some API changes.
Please read our [post](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2018/03/05/complex-patch) to learn more about changes and installation process.

## testing
We use lot of tests in the development of sensenet that's why their runtime and effectiveness are really important. We are using unit testing to test small parts of the source code therefore we can quickly locate errors without reviewing the whole code. In Q1 we optimized most of our existing tests and added new ones as well. Thanks to optimization, the runtime of these tests is now much shorter so we are able to run more tests in less time.
