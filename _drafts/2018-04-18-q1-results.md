## First sn7 patch
Back in March [sensenet 7.1](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet/releases/tag/v7.1.0) was published packed with many under the hood changes. Major changes was made in indexing and querying generalization. All of these modifications are needed to prepare Lucene search engine to work as a service intead of as a local inddex. In this first phase no changes has been made in architectural level however you may need to rebuild or update some libraries before executing the patch due to some API changes.
Please read our [post](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2018/03/05/complex-patch) to learn more about changes and installation process.

## scoped packages

The whole idea behind scoped packages was to divide overgrown client side packages into smaller ones and publish these new, refactored packages under @sensenet scope.
Simplifying API and get rid of external dependencies like RxJs library were also among our goals when we started this project a few months ago.

Take a look at our new packages and their dependencies:
