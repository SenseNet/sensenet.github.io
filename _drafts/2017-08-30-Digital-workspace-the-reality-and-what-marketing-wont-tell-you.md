The [digital workplace](https://www.sensenet.com/for-customers/use-cases/digital-workplace) means a workplace that does not exist in physical space to which the work group members can connect from any part of the world. This is usually the result of several work stations connected through servers, however the work group members can access the network even by using home computers. Thus the digital workplace primarily consists of workers, hardware and software and online work processes. 

## How can the digital workplace be used?

The solution can be used by almost any industry thanks to the simple, fast and secure document handling, content services and development platforms. Not to mention the significant improvement of the work experience.

## Are there areas where it cannot be applied?

The dark side of the digital workplace is not related to being compatible with certain industries but in the social changes caused by this method. [Paul Miller](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Workplace-Technology-Liberating-Work/dp/1457510960) in his book, *The Digital Workplace: How Technology is Liberating Work,* discusses how the digital workplace can cause addiction that can damage our social life.

According to Miller, if anybody can work from anywhere at any time the work is going to take up more and more of our everyday life, as we see work as less of a burden. This can easily lead to the development of workaholism which can have severe symptoms. When using digital workplace application, it is necessary to pay attention to leave ourselves enough free time for recreation. We should not neglect our friends and family.

## How is it more effective: a distinct body of systems or one system that solves everything?

You certainly had the experience that the more software you use to conduct a project, the harder it is to control the work process. As in such a case you need to divide your attention, which on the long term is not effective. Not to mention how annoying it is when a project cannot be finished due to some project file compatibility problems.
