## sensenet 7 stable release

One of the biggest milestone of last year was [sensenet 7 stable release](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2017/12/06/release-7.0-stable) back in december. With the new version, the core source code did not changed much, but SN 7 introduces a new, [componentized era](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2017/09/27/new-sn7-components), by slicing up the product to bulding blocks or components.
After four beta releases we introduced the stable sensenet 7 release. After that, we will publish patches for SN 7 so you can already start working on new projects using the new version, we have your back.

## Componentization
As mentioned before, SN 7 is no more one huge software, it is built by different components which can be added to the core Services component based on your own needs.
Once this core layer, mother of all components is installed in your project, you can already start working on your solution but we have some really useful components to help you out.

- [Workflow](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/76)
[Workflow component](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-workflow)
Workflows are a great tool for building business processes involving content creation and response to human interactions (approving a document, completing a task or clicking on a link in a mail). We integrated Windows Workflow Foundation 4.5 into sensenet ECM to have a well-known and standard framework for defining and developing workflows.
You will be able to use the full workflow engine and API, even if you only have the Services layer installed. Starting/stopping workflows, automatic wake-up and polling will work.
All built-in workflows (approval, registration, forgotten password) will work without the UI layer, but you'll have to make the necessary content modifications (e.g. setting the result of a task) that these workflows expect programmatically (or on your custom UI) to move them forward. In case you want out of the box UI elements for workflows, install Webpages components which gives a UI framework for sensenet built on ASP.NET WebForms.

- [Notification](https://github.com/sensenet/sensenet/issues/77)
Notification is a feature for users who want to be informed about Content changes in the system. Users can subscribe to notifications on possible changes to Content items. Notifications are email messages sent to the subsriberâ€™s address. Similarly to the Workflow, you may install this component even if you only have the sensenet Services main component installed. That way you'll get the backend notification framework with a .Net API. 
You can also add Webpages component so you'll get UI elements: notification actions and portlets with content views - a full user interface for subscribing to content events and an admin UI for managing notifications.
