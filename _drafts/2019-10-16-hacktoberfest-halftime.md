## How It's Going So Far 🚀

Being the middle of october is a great opportunity to take a look back and see how far we get together and also to see what else could we achieve in the next few weeks.

As you probably know sensenet rewards the first 100 contributors with an extra swag (limited edition sensenet hacktoberfest t-shirt and a nice sticker) if they join us in celebration by registering [here on this form](https://sensenet.com/Hacktoberfest2019). 170 of you applied to participate so far, but don't worry, not all of them did meet the other requirement up to now. Although almost 250 pull requests was made by you in the last two weeks, 25 more t-shirts are left to reward some of you with them. 🎁 

We’re looking forward to seeing what else you’re working on, so if you’re still heading toward hitting your goal, here’s some inspiration and a few tips to get started.

## Ideas on where to start

As we stated at the start of hacktoberfest, the issues which we believe can be easily accomplished are marked with the ```hacktoberfest``` label. It is still the case, despite the fact that such tasks, especially the very simple ones, were taken very soon. We continue to encourage everyone to choose from these issues and look back to 👉 [this list](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asensenet+label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22+is%3Aopen&type=Issues) 👈 as often as possible, new tasks are constantly being added.

## Quality standards

As some of you have experienced, there are cases when issues are labeled as ```invalid``` by us (which means the labeled pr is not count and you you won't get it until you do another, non-invalid PR). Yes, we said in the [previous blog post] that every little change counts, but at the same time it wouldn't be fair from us to accept a request _"that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October"_. Please accept that we follow the [hacktoberfest quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality-standards). If you believe that your PR was unfairly flagged as invalid, please begin a conversation within the related PR and explain your position.

Lastly, for related news follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sensenet). We strive to provide #hacktobetfest relevant information every day during october.
