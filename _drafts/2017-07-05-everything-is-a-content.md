The foundation of sensenet ECM is the Content Repository, where documents, tasks, users, projects – everything is a Content. It is the fundamental building block of the system that makes content management easy and powerful at the same time.

---

Using content items everywhere unlocks a great deal of exceptional features that make your experience as a user more seamless, and your job as a developer a lot easier. Focus on the business problem – the platform handles the rest!

## Why is this a cool thing?

### Unified, easy-to-learn techniques for working with content
How do you change document metadata? Edit its properties! How do you modify a User, or add details to a Task? Well, Edit its properties, of course! A unified user interface: same menus, same buttons, same operations help feel familiar with every part of the system immediately.

### Services and actions available for all content
If there is a new feature, it can be enabled for all kinds of content immediately – think of the Copy or Delete actions for example. You can copy a file or a whole workspace the same way.

This goes for your custom actions too! You can define new features and enable them for all kinds of content – or just for the types you need them for.

### Content management in a central place
If everything is a content, why not store and manage them in a central place? You'll find every single item in the Content Repository in our huge content tree! Combined with a powerful search engine this makes content discovery a no-brainer.

The built-in Content Explorer, our admin UI lets you browse, edit and manage content – the whole tree – in a familiar, rich environment.

## Got it, give me the features!

Although it is virtually impossible to squeeze every important feature of a modern enterprise content management system into a single article, we wanted to give you a glimpse of what sensenet ECM is capable of when it comes to document management.

### Custom metadata
A unified content infrastructure lets you define custom metadata fields on a high level and use them on specific types. The Display name field for example is defined on the base Content Type called GenericContent – and that gives you a display name field for basically every content in the system!

### Presentation
It is just a single step from storing data in a unified way to displaying it using predefined UI building blocks. Create and re-use field controls and content views, and speed up your development process by assembling skins, pages and page templates – which are also content themselves ;-).

### Version history
It takes only a few clicks to enable versioning – not just for files, but for any kind of content! Want to keep old versions of a Memo or a Task? Choose from the available versioning modes, and you're good to go! You can switch this on in a library, a workspace, or any level in the Content Repository.

### Approval
Collaborate with others on documents, specifications, tasks! The built-in simple approval process that can be enabled for any kind of content makes the usually cumbersome and time-consuming process super-easy and fast in sensenet ECM.

### Permission on content level
The security system that is built into the core layer of sensenet ECM lets you manage permissions on the level of your choice: it is easy to define them on a workspace or library, but if you need to, you can even control the accessibility of a single content – be it a document, a group or a JavaScript file.

### Fast search by metadata
A unified Content Repository extended with our Lucene search engine lets you find the content you need quickly. You can also create complex queries in an easy-to-master query language to build the flexible and rich user interface you imagined.
