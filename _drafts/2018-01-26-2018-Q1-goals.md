short introduction

### Growing community
- in-house Community (Reward) System
    - ask and answer on stackoverflow and gain predefined amount of reputation quarterly
        - help snteam to answer questions on stackoverflow
        - make an active community around the sensenet tag
        - move in-house questions product related questions to stackoverflow will help also the outside community
    - making predefined amount of sensenet related or non-related pull requests quarterly
        - pr's labeled with ```help wanted``` to mark good first questions
        - help our developers outside the product team to follow the guidelines that are common in the opensource world
        - help other opensource projects
    - in-house website to follow status of 'competition'
    - in-house training materials and workshops

### DMS MVP
- publish
- test
- measure

### Control packages

### Refactor search module
- Make a generalized layer for information retrieval operations (indexing and querying). This will decouple search operations from the underlying technology.
- Lucene Search service: create a standalone, separately deployable service based on the current Lucene indexing implementation. This is important in a cloud environment, where you cannot have a local index on the web server.

### Messaging and caching
- In the cloud the current MSMQ messaging implementation is not feasible. We want to come up with a more modern server-to-server communication architecture that will help operators use sensenet in an auto-scalable cloud environment.

### Training materials
-  First for in-house developers
    - TypeScript, ES6+
    - ReactJS, Redux, Aureliajs
    - sn-client-js, sn-redux, sn-controls-x other sn related frontend packages
    - tools: testing, CI, documentation, linters

### Tutorials
- Install video
- First steps with
    - MVC + sensenet
    - reactjs + sensenet
    - aureliajs + sensenet

### Scoped packages
 - Split our NPM packages into smaller ones and move them in the **@sensenet** [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) on NPM
 - Strict review on our 3rd party dependencies
 - Optimizations on our package bundle sizes
 - Allow client functions to work with [immutable objects](https://redux.js.org/docs/faq/ImmutableData.html)
 - Massive code decoupling and refactor
 - [related issue](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-js/issues/67)

### New components
- preview generator
- document viewer
