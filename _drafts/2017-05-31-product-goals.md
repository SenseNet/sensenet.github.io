## Everybody needs goals

Us, too. In fact we need better goals, than *"making more money"* or *"creating better stuff"*. So last year we decided to be [SMART][bb699076] about it and set high-level product goals for ourselves and for our community. Afterall, we want to be the best ECM development platform for a large community of developers. But how do we get there?

## What goals?
#### Agility boost
We realized that our time to market is too slow. One reason behind this was that the product was too monolithic to begin with. It is the pitfall of legacy code everywhere. The team was battling bugs and new feature requests without refactoring for a while, so it is now time for a big overhaul.
If you look closely at our [repositories][ce0fc2d5], you may see that componentization has already started. What was one big chunk of code in the old sensenet ECM, now consists of 2 separate packages. There are at least 4 more to come. Once we're done, we'll aim to release hotfixes every other week and have feature releases at least once in a quarter (depending on the size of the feature).

#### Product identity redesign
The *sensenet* brand was long neglected, all of us needed something new. Something modern. Our site had obsolete information and our [documentation][8206ff40] was losing its edge too. As you can see, this too, is changing. New logo, new site design and features. New communication: sensenet ECM is a *development platform* that gives you the perfect tools for building [intranets][8f9b4f00] or [content repositories][bc64591a].

We documented part of our transition to the new site in a previous blog post [here][dbea5825].

#### Measure *all the things*
The team wanted to know if we were developing the right features for the right set of people. We needed better channels for communication and lots of data. Right now we aggregate a fair amount of [GitHub][bebd2231] statistics with [NuGet][80c6156c], [npm][ffdb2e87], [Twitter][0c3b4e3a], [Facebook][b175e3d7] and Google Analytics data so we can have a clearer picture of our "community health". The next step is product-related usage statistics: it is crucial to know how people use our product and how can we create better user experiences.

Follow us on [Twitter][0c3b4e3a], like us on [Facebook][b175e3d7], or [clone the repository][bebd2231] and we'll need to check on our stats. We'll hate that (not really, so please, be a good champ).

#### Become a more accessible development platform
Developers like to use tools that make their lives easier. The team is determined to deliver a product that is modular, easy to understand, well documented and augmented with tools that make you [feel like flying][2fc61619] when creating a company intranet for a client. This can only be done if we have a community of developers who can tell us what they think. Why don't **you** tell us, what you think? Hop on [gitter][71fe2b44] and say hi. [Try out][f482c883] sensenet ECM and tell us what you think!
