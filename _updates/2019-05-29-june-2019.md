Another 4 weeks went by, here are the changes we made 👇🏻

## Monorepo changes
- Reviewed our dependencies and moved all the packages to root that couldn't be run from the package
  - eg: Typescript could not be run in a package without the monorepo structure because the tsconfig.json extends the config in the root
