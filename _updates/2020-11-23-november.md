## Bye-bye Hacktoberfest 👋

Hacktoberfest 2020 is over, thanks for all the contributors. Limited edition super socks will arrive soon ✈️. We really enjoyed the last few weeks, the joint work went smoothly. Other than that a refactoring period was maintained by us. Two main package was touched, but in this release only one is published: **@sensenet/controls-react**. @sensenet/document-viewer-react will change soon with even more stable operation. ⌚
We also fixed bugs as usual, bugfixing never ends. 🐛

Here are the changes what we made:

### admin-ui@1.14.0

- We have new cypress end-to-end tests. Thank you again for the contributors! ✨

- There were some components which did not follow the font-size-change of google chrome. Now this is fixed, you can use sensenet with large or extra large font-sizes as well. 👓 [#1075](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1075)

- Some error messages were not handled correctly on group membership dialog, now it is fixed. 💬 [#1080](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1080)

- A notification problem was also noticed during query writing which has been resolved. ⚠️ [#1081](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1081)

- You can use now reference fields in your custom menuitems. ⏬ [#1021](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1021)

**How can you try?**

1. Add a new AllowedChildTypes item to Sample Workspace (SmartFolder)
2. Create a New SmartFolder under Sample Workspace with the following options: (query: +TypeIs:'Task' +Status:'Active')

![ActiveTask](/img/active-task.png "ActiveTask")

3. Go to /personal-settings and copy this to the text area:

```
{
   "theme": "dark",
   "default": {
      "drawer": {
         "items": [
            {
               "itemType": "CustomContent",
               "settings": {
                  "icon": "AddAlert",
                  "title": "ActiveTask",
                  "appPath": "activeTask",
                  "root": "/Root/Content/SampleWorkspace/ActiveTask",
                  "columns": [
                     "Name",
                     "ModifiedBy/Email",
                     "ModifiedBy/Manager/Manager/Email",
                     "ModifiedBy/Manager/Name",
                     "ModifiedBy/Manager"
                  ],
                  "description": "List of accounts that should be notified"
               }
            }
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

In this example I modified the related Task with businesscat, I set the Manager of businessscat to devdog (whose manager is editormanatee)

The result: 

![ActiveTaskResult](/img/active-task-result.png "ActiveTaskResult")




### @sensenet/client-core@3.6.0

- New function is added to SchemaStore [#2021](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1021)

```typescript
/**
   * Returns the Field Type for the provided content field name
   * @param {string} fieldName The name of field you search for
   */
  public getFieldTypeByName(fieldName: string): string | undefined {
    const schemasCopy = [...this.schemas.getValue()]
    return schemasCopy.reduce((_, schema: Schema) => {
      const fieldType = schema.FieldSettings.find((fieldSetting: FieldSetting) => fieldSetting.Name === fieldName)?.Type
      if (fieldType) {
        schemasCopy.length = 0
      }
      return fieldType
    }, undefined)
  }
```

### @sensenet/list-controls-react@1.5.0

- New optional prop is added to virtualized-table:

```typescript
/**
* Contains custom reference cell template components
*/
referenceCellRenderer?: (tableCellProps: TableCellProps) => React.ReactNode
```

### @sensenet/default-content-types@3.1.0

`isCurrencyFieldSetting` typeGuard is moved from **sn-controls-react** to **default-content-types**

### @sensenet/controls-react@6.0.0

Last, but not least this package has been reshaped, now it is much better than it was. ☀️👌🌟
