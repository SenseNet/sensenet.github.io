## First release of the SNaaS era ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

As you probably already know we've started SNaaS (sensenet as a service) as beta in October so this will be our first release that will affect not only our test environments but also a several public repositories owned by you. Exciting, isn't it? :) We put together a few fixes, some refactored components and we got some e2e tests made by awesome hacktoberfest contributors. Here are the changes what we made:

### admin-ui@1.13.0

- To make it easier for you to ask us for help right away or give feedback directly on the admin-ui, weâ€™ve built a new help menu [#999](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/issues/999)
