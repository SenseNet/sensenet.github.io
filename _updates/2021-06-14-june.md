# June 2021

The last release of this quarter contains the initial steps made in the direction of effortless text content editing and the first version of a gatsby source plugin. Both are just the beginning, the next weeks will be about further refining. Letâ€™s see what we did so far:

## admin-ui@1.21.0
- Text editor library behind rich text editor is changed to [tiptap@2.0](https://www.tiptap.dev/). As a first step only those text editing features are implemented that were available in the previous version. More new things (managing tables, embedding, etc.) are coming in the following releases.
