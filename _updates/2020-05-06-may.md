## Out with the old in with the new ‚è©

Good bye [@zoltanbedi](https://github.com/zoltanbedi), welcome new friend [@taki9](https://github.com/taki9)! In this release we did a bunch of breaking changes. We changed the authentication under sensenet to a new robust solution which is IdentityServer4. Because of this we are releasing a react component library for helping working with it. Check it out! We have also refactored our admin ui and example apps to use the new authentication method.

### @sensenet/authentication-oidc-react@1.0.0 üÜï

@sensenet/authentication-oidc-react is a react component library that uses React context api for authenticating with oidc client.
There are 2 components and 1 hook that you can use. `AuthenticationProvider`, `OidcSecure`, `useOidcAuthentication`.

**Example**

```typescript
import { AuthenticationProvider, useOidcAuthentication, UserManagerSettings } from '@sensenet/authentication-oidc-react'
import { Repository } from '@sensenet/client-core'
import { RepositoryContext } from '@sensenet/hooks-react'
import React, { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
import { BrowserRouter, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom'

export const repositoryUrl = 'https://my-service.sensenet.com/'

export const configuration: UserManagerSettings = {
  client_id: '', //clientId for your repository
  automaticSilentRenew: true,
  redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/callback',
  response_type: 'code',
  post_logout_redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/',
  scope: 'openid profile sensenet',
  authority: 'https://is.my-service.sensenet.com/',
  silent_redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/authentication/silent_callback',
  extraQueryParams: { snrepo: repositoryUrl },
}

export function AppProviders({ children }: PropsWithChildren<{}>) {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <AuthProvider>
        <RepositoryProvider>{children}</RepositoryProvider>
      </AuthProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }: PropsWithChildren<{}>) => {
  const history = useHistory()

  return (
    <AuthenticationProvider configuration={configuration} history={history}>
      {children}
    </AuthenticationProvider>
  )
}

export const RepositoryProvider = ({ children }: PropsWithChildren<{}>) => {
  const { oidcUser } = useOidcAuthentication()

  if (!oidcUser) {
    return <LoginForm />
  }

  return (
    <RepositoryContext.Provider value={new Repository({ repositoryUrl, token: oidcUser.access_token })}>
      {children}
    </RepositoryContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

### @sensenet/client-core@3.0.0 üëÄ

- Changed RepositoryConfiguration from class to interface for better typing experience. It is not tightly coupled with GenericContent now.
- ‚ùó sessionLifetime property is moved from repository configuration to JWTService
- üÜï token can be passed to the repository configuration. This will be sent with all requests as an Authorization header.

- **Breaking change:** Functions belonging to allowed child types moved from the repository object to `repository.allowedChildTypes` as:
  - add
  - update
  - remove
  - get
  - getImplicit
  - getExplicit
  - getFromCTD
  - listEmpty

- New methods available on the repository to manage document previews accessible by `repository.preview` object:
  - getPageCount
  - getExistingImages
  - available
  - regenerate
  - check
  - getComments
  - addComment
  - deleteComment

- New methods to get metadata and the value of a property of a content on the `repository`:
  - getMetadata
  - getPropertyValue

### Admin-ui@1.7.0

- Route handling is reworked. From now on the app has user friendly URL paths.

- Delete action added to the context menu for files. [#633](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/633)

- Document viewer design improvements. [#658](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/658)

- New delete, move and copy buttons added to the content list for batch operations. They're shown when multiple items are selected  [#631](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/631)

- Items on the content list are selected if left click on them once [#637](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/637)

- Loader added to the copy and move dialogs during the actions are in progress. [#639](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/639)

- Share, Restore and Preview actions are temporarily disabled until the related screens and logic are finished.

- fix: Result from command palette's search dropdown and double-clicks on a folder in the result on the search page navigated the user to an empty page. The default value of a property had to be set. [#646](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/646)

- fix: Content list table next to the loader was shown during data loading. [#641](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/641)

- fix: date format was not consistent with the chosen language [#659](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/659)
