## Best time of the year 🎄 🎁

Another year went by, we worked a lot to make our code more stable and improve the user experience of the admin ui. We left one of the biggest rework for Christmas: the completely refactored DocViewer. 📄 We don't stop there, we will work on it on the next month to make it more customizable and we also add new features to it. 🛠️

Here are the changes what we made:

### admin-ui@1.15.0

- Our logo has borrowed Santa's hat again 🎅

- More accurate error messages for the user status switcher on the Users & Groups page.

### @@sensenet/document-viewer-react@3.0.0

- The whole library is revamped. We tried to make it more usable, stable and easier to develop for it.
