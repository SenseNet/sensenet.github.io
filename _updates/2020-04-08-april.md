## Work From Home 🏠

Because of the pandemic we are now working from home. This doesn't mean that the development is stopped. Here are the changes we made.

### @sensenet/redux@5.3.0

- Added some missing actions for
  - put
  - content creation with a content template
  - preview related actions
  - preview comments
  - allowedchildtypes
  - restore from trash
  - add/remove list fields

### @sensenet/document-viewer-react@2.0.6

- fix: adding comments returned error, because the x and y coordinates were floating numbers and the request body was not a valid json. These two params' type is changed to string. [#617](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/617)

### sn-dms-demo@2.0.1

- DMS demo is refactored to use create react app.

### Admin-ui@1.6.0
