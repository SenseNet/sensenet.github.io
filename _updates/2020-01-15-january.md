## üî• Hotfix release [2020.1.1](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/releases/tag/2020.1.1)
In this release there are couple of api changes. We needed to refactor those code because the logic inside failed when function names were minified.

## client-core
- `getSchema` method from SchemaStore is removed. Use the `getSchemaByName` method instead. Be aware that this is case sensitive so `"genericcontent"` **won't** be equal to `"GenericContent"`
- `isContentFromType` takes a contentTypeName(string) as a second parameter now instead of an `T` type. To get proper typing support use the generic type like this `isContentFromType<Setting>(content, 'Setting')`

## client-utils
- Trace - you have to provide a unique name in the trace options now. There is a new options called `methodName`.

## control-mapper
- `setupFieldSettingDefault` method now takes a string as first parameter instead of function. To get full typing support use it like this
```js
controlMapper.setupFieldSettingDefault<ChoiceFieldSetting>('ChoiceFieldSetting', setting => {})
```
Be aware that this is case sensitive so choicefieldsetting **won't** be equal to ChoiceFieldSetting
