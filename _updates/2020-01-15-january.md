## üéÜü•Ç Happy New Year 2020

We're kicking of the new year with some bug fixes and performance improvements for the Admin-ui.

## Admin-ui@1.4.1

-  We moved the add button from the bottom right to the left side menu [#520](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/520)
- Clicking the add button now opens a drop down instead of the bottom drawer [#528](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/528)

- You can now change the theme from the new profile menu. Also we changed the default theme to light ü§ç [#525](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/525)

- We now bundle production code this is now means a decrease in the bundle size üìâ [#532](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/532)

## Packages

### @sensenet/client-core@2.2.6

- There is a barrel file in every folder now so you can import `RepositoryConfiguration` like this
```js
import { RepositoryConfiguration } from '@sensenet/client-ore'
```
instead of this
```js
import { RepositoryConfiguration } from '@sensenet/client-ore/dist/Repository/RepositoryConfiguration'
```
### @sensenet/client-utils@1.7.3

- There is a new `BrowserConsoleLogger` that formats the messages in a way that all modern browsers understand
