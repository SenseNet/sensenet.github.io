# April 2021 🌸

"The Romans gave this month the Latin name Aprilis but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb aperire, "to open", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to "open", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of άνοιξη (ánixi) (opening) for spring." /from Wikipedia/ 🌷💐

For us not only the flowers and trees are blooming, but the second quarter has also begun. We have many plans for Q2 and we are really excited to share them with you soon. We would like to redesign our example apps and we also would like to add some new ones - the work has already started on this. We also updated the whole build process, so you have more options now for using our packages. 🔧

-----------

## admin-ui@1.19.0

We were also busy with fixing bugs in the last couple of weeks, e.g.: 🐛

[#1251](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1251) ⏰
The end2end tests made it clear to us that a lot depends on the timing, so we added a loader to the 'Add button list' till it loads the new list.

[#1252](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1252) 🚩
We cleaned up type icons as well, now it is more flexible to use them, then ever before. You can select the type icon what you would like to display from the CTD itself.

[#1279](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1279) ♻️
Another key point that we are working on is webhooks. We would like to create as many webhook templates as we can to make your life easier.
Keep up with the next releases, the templates will be available soon and the first step to reach them was the make webhook payload editable .

[#1248](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1248), [#1250](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1250).


## @sensenet/document-viewer-react@4.1.0

In document viewer we had also some bugs or missing features what we did solve:

[#1259](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1259) 📑
There was a bug in comment marker placing on inactive page, now it is working properly.

[#1256](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1256) 🔄
One edgecase is also has been adressed: if the backend cannot generate previews for a long time, it will not affect other opreations, infinite loop cannot be occured.

[#1260](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1260) 🚫
Comment marker and shape placing at the same time is not available from now.

## @sensenet/universal-header-react@0.1.0

A newcomer arrived in our packages: the universal header [#1231](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1231) 💫

Universal header was created to standardize our exmaple apps, but this header component can be used by anyone.
It has three main parts:

- Hamburger menu (with links of our main documentation and helper stuff) 🍔
- Title (can be overwritten)
- Three-dot menu (can be a custom menu for your app)

## @examples/gatsby-blog@0.1.0

There's a newbie example app as well: gatsby-blog.
In this version it uses the sources from the file system, but the new source will be a sensenet repository soon. 😍

You should also check the changes in the build system here: [#1234](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/1234)

As you know we've been putting a lot of effort on optimization lately, so check out our article [here](https://dev.to/taki9/dynamic-import-recipe-for-a-lightning-fast-application-2fa0) about it.

See you in next month! 🙋👋
