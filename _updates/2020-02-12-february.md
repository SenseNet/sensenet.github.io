## ğŸ’›ğŸ’™Valentine's Day 2020ğŸ’œğŸ’š

It is the time to love and be loved. 
Here are the changes what we made last month. We hope that you will love them ğŸ’—ğŸ‘‡
In this release we were about to optimize the admin-ui.

## sn-redux
- We have changed the type of `persistedState` (Initial state of the store)  from `DeepPartial<T>` to `PreloadedState<T>`.

## Admin-ui@1.4.3

- We spent time on optimizing our frontend
[#550](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/550)
and we also tried to reduce the bundle size
[#554](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/554)
If you would like to read about the optimization process check our blogbost [here](https://community.sensenet.com/blog/2020/01/18/time-is-money)

ğŸ’•Happy Valentine's Day! ğŸ’•
