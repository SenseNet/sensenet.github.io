## ðŸ’›ðŸ’™Valentine's Day 2020ðŸ’œðŸ’š

It is the time to love and be loved. 
Here are the changes what we made last month. We hope that you will love them ðŸ’—ðŸ‘‡
In this release we were about to optimize the admin-ui.

## Admin-ui@1.4.3

We fixed the 'add new content' dialog [#538](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/538)

We fixed some bugs on the drawer [#526](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/526)


We started using relative-ci-agent webpack plugin
This way we don't have to:
- Run a new travis job
- Less configuration and code in snapp 
[#545](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/545)

We had to move the Search button from bottom-right because it it a dedicated place for out chat application. Now you can use clicking the add button for search in Search menu.

We refactored the use-drawer-item hook
[#529](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/529)

We spent time on optimizing our frontend as well
[#550](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/550)
and we also tried to reduce the bundle size
[#554](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client/pull/554)
