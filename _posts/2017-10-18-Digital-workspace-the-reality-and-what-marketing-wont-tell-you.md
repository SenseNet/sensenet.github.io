## What is a digital workplace?

The [digital workplace](https://www.sensenet.com/for-customers/use-cases/digital-workplace) does not exist in physical form - it is central workspace to which the members can connect to from any part of the world. This is usually the result of several workstations connected through servers, however the work group members can access the network even by using their home computers or smart phones. Thus the digital workplace primarily consists of people, hardware, software and online work processes. 

## Benefits of going digital

The solution can be used in almost any industry thanks to the simple, fast and secure document handling, content services and development platforms. Not to mention the significant improvement of the work experience.

It can help education as well thanks to the online platforms provided by the system that allows teachers and students to connect to it anywhere and anytime. The online workplace makes sharing school knowledge, talent promotion and the related administration easy.

A digital workplace brings significant results in the area of financial services as well. This opportunity entails the modernizing of the IT infrastructure of a given financial business, sharing confidential data securely and handling legal restrictions, obligations and license management as well.

A digital workplace can reduce the costs of healthcare, the savings created thus can be used to improve the quality of healthcare. The software available on desktop and mobile devices as well can unify and make patient information easily accessible and securely stored for the doctor and patient as well.

Many well-known companies worldwide, like Google, Microsoft or the British London Capital Group also enjoy the advantages provided by the digital workplace.

## Are there areas where it cannot be applied?

The dark side of the digital workplace is not related to being compatible with certain industries but with the social changes caused by this method. [Paul Miller](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Workplace-Technology-Liberating-Work/dp/1457510960) in his book, *The Digital Workplace: How Technology is Liberating Work,* discusses how the digital workplace can cause addiction that can damage our social life.

According to Miller, if anybody can work from anywhere at any time the work is going to take up more and more of our everyday life, as we see work as less of a burden. This can easily lead to the development of workaholism which can have severe symptoms. When using digital workplace application, it is necessary to pay attention to leave ourselves enough free time for recreation. We should not neglect our friends and family.

## How is it more effective: a distinct body of systems or one system that solves everything?

You certainly had the experience that the more software you use to conduct a project, the harder it is to control the work process. As in such a case you need to divide your attention, which on the long term is not effective. Not to mention how annoying it is when a project cannot be finished due to some project file compatibility problems.
