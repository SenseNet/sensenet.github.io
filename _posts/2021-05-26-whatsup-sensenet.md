demo experience

This repository demonstrates the basic setup of sensenet with a demo content set to try out its capabilities.  



It also contains every content used by our example apps (images, tasks, events, etc.). Add new task in the Todo app for example and check your new content in the admin ui and vice-versa. 



This demo gives a good insight into the content structure of a common project giving the opportunity to verify the functionality with making a proof of concept trying out the API and admin surface.
