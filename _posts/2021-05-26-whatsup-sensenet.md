As a result of our design sprint (back in april), we found that most people don't really like to add any personal details (even an email address) to try out a new solution. This is where a live demo omes handy since you don't need to register to be able to check if a product fits to your needs.

Once this was clear to us we started to gather ideas to understand and make the journey of a user more seamless. We already had every piece for that (website, try it page, example apps, demo repo) however the whole thing did not came together as a smooth experience.

The concept was to connect the example apps to our demo repository and by this to demonstrate how a simple app works with sensenet.
Since the demo repository already contains every content used by our example apps (images, tasks, events, etc.) it was straightforward to make this clearer for our users with links, buttons and also some texts explaining the connection.

demo experience

This repository demonstrates the basic setup of sensenet with a demo content set to try out its capabilities.  



It also contains every content used by our example apps (images, tasks, events, etc.). Add new task in the Todo app for example and check your new content in the admin ui and vice-versa. 



This demo gives a good insight into the content structure of a common project giving the opportunity to verify the functionality with making a proof of concept trying out the API and admin surface.
