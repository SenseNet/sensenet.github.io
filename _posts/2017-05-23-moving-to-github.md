We moved. To **Github**, with our code and management toolsâ€¦ and our documentation **and** this blog(!); and to Stack Overflow with your questions and our answers.

---

Finally. Okay, we've been moving to these platforms for almost a year, but still. We haven't yet had the chance to tell anyone. Also, I think this is the stage when one can look around and say that - in spite of the several unopened boxes and the fact that the paint is not yet dried on the wall - sensenet is finally home again.

So why did we suddenly drop Codeplex and our own Forum (and blog) in favor of external services?

## Visibility,  visibility, visibility
We can be [the best .NET Open Source Enterprise Content Management System in the Universe][e68b21b6] if no one knows about it, right? And the World has moved a lot since we set up the tools we have been using since.

## GitHub is the de-facto place for open source
It just really makes [sense][00c66cf2] for us to be there as well. This way, we can focus on development and on delivering the most value for everyone involved. We'd like to continue giving a lot of value to our Community (and even more to our Enterprise customers) so you'll see some buzz near our repositories.

## Increased productivity
Over the past years we used a plethora of tools for managing our development process. Now, almost everything is on GitHub. In the last 3 sprints we tried out the[ ZenHub chrome extension][03b7e478] and so far, it's great. Before this we had a separate backlog, we had our issues in Jira (to be fair, for our [enterprise customers][09dba056], we still do) and we had several repositories in TFS. It was a convoluted process to put together a decent release and even more complicated to get feedback from our users. Now you can:
- Chat with us on [Gitter][ab968762]
- Throw your issues and bugs at us using [GitHub issues][56f9b622]
- Have your questions answered on [Stack Overflow][dca19257]
- And even Contribute by either fixing a bug or expanding our documentation - all in one place

## Happy  Coder, happy community
We are also in the process of moving our [community codebase](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet) from TFS hoping to achieve better time-to-market and happier users who'll get our hotfixes and new features considerably faster.

So there. Now it is all out there in the open, waiting for you to [take part][00d572b0].
