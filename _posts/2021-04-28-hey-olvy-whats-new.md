## How to deliver releases and updates

Since we are working on our new SaaS model we are thinking how could we improve each and every part of the service. Admin-ui, which is a central place to manage sensenet repositories in the (SNaaS model), needed a section with useful information for our users, such as release notes, new and upcoming features.

We were thinking what could be the best way to deliver these infos to our users then we found a promising tool on [producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). The app is called Olvy and it was #1 product of the day (back in 27 February) that's how we found it.

Here we would like to mention that this is not a paid promotion (we paid full price for Olvy altough we took advantage of the early bird discount), we just share our experience with this service.

## Integration

The integration part was quite easy, we just had to add a small code snippet into the admin ui and tag a button with the appropriate id, that's it.
We were so amazed by this new solution that we've included it to each site.

## What we share

First of all it is the ideal place for us to share info about our new releases like new features, fixed bugs and so on (both forntend and backend). In addition to release notes we also share our blogposts and other news around sensenet.

Olvy has even more features like [standalone page](https://sensenet.olvy.co/) for releases, feedback (which we plan to use in the future), scheduled releases and many more.
