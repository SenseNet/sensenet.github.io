## How to deliver releases and updates

Since we are working on our new SaaS model we are thinking how could we improve each and every part of the service. Admin-ui, which is a central place to manage sensenet repositories in the (SNaaS model), needed a section with useful information for our users, such as release notes, new and upcoming features.

We were thinking what could be the best way to deliver these infos to our users then we found a promising tool on [producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). The app is called Olvy and it was #1 product of the day (back in 27 February) that's how we found it.

Here we would like to mention that this is not a paid promotion (we paid full price for Olvy altough we took advantage of the early bird discount), we just share our experience with this service.

## Integration



content to share
- blogpost
- frontend and backend releases
- news around sensenet

in the future (possibilities)
- feedback

easy to use and intuitive interface (some screenshots maybe)

this is not a paid promotion we just found this solution and happy to use it and share our experience in a form of a blogpost (we paid full money for olvy)
