🌇 “Cities grow, cities evolve, cities have parts that simply die while other parts flourish; each city has to be renewed in order to meet the needs of its populace…” 🌆 -Grady Booch

The basic purpose of code refactoring is to make the code more efficient and maintainable. Of course we are about to keep our code up-to-date and optimize its performance so we thought that it is time to clean a lot of complicated lines of code in the document viewer. ♻️

# Logic ✏️✂️🚀🐛👭

The main goal was to simplify the code. There were some magic numbers, unnecessary props, useEffects that run many times, so we had to go deep to rethink the logic. After planning, we had to rebuild functions based on the existing code. Although we try to avoid code repetition, sometimes it is even necessary to break down existing logic according to its function. As a result, Thumbnails and PageList became two separate components, for example. ✏️

Not only the code has become simpler but also some of the features. For example, rotating pages is only a form of visual representation, so it is unnecessary to store this information, it can be reproduced anytime. SearchBar widget become redundant too, because all browsers can search on page, so we removed this from selectable widgets. ✂️

We've put a great emphasis on improving performance as well. Sometimes we can achieve significant results by making small changes, such as taking advantage of the opportunities provided by our framework: replacing useEffect with [useMemo](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo). 🚀

Finding and fixing bugs in the software is also important in case of a full review like this. Of course, during the re-rolling of this function, we also encountered many cases where a different solution had to be applied than we originally planned. 🐛

The point is that we tried to look at the possibilities from the user's point of view and we were trying to make this feature user friendly.👭

# Style 🎨

We will release another new option to users, which is overwriting styles from a higher level. It is very important to enable users to shape our solution for their own needs. So far there have been relatively few opportunities for it, but we are changing that now:

You can define your style on your own and you can pass it to the component itself, like:

```javascript
const useDisabledStyle = makeStyles(() =>
  createStyles({
    iconButton: {
      "&:disabled": {
        opacity: 0.26,
      },
    },
  })
);

const disabledStyle = useDisabledStyle();
```

If you use typescript you can also see the possible classes what you can overwrite:

Since our designer always come up with new solutions and the style is constantly changing, we can never consider it done. 🎡

# New features 🎉

For those who have been using sensenet for a long time, it may not be new, but if you have just joined, you may come across the keywords redaction, highlight and annotation for the first time.

**Redaction** 🔳

Sometimes when you are working with sensitive information 🗝️ in documents you don’t want to share them with everyone, only users having the appropriate privileges. What if you would like to share the document except the sensitive information? This is the case when you need to apply redaction.
With this feature you can hide parts of your doc with a black rectangles. Opening a document without redaction is only possible if the user has permission for it, otherwise the page will be full with black squares. 🙈

**Highlight** ⭐

The purpose of highlighting is to draw attention to important information in a text. 📑

**Annotation** 💬

Annotation is extra information associated with a particular point in a document. It can be a note that includes a comment, explanation or anything what you would like to share with the audience in a designated place in the text. 📋

**Usage**

The operation of these three shapes is basically the same with some small differences:
- you can create them with a click-move-click method (check gifs) ✏️
- you can delete them with `backspace` or `delete` keys (except annotations) and also with a `right-click` on the shape then choosing delete button on the popout. 🚮
- you can also drag and drop the shapes if you would like to move them to another position on the page. ↖️↘️
- right-clicking on shapes opens different popups. For the redactions and highlights only a delete button appears, but for annotations, a toolkit with different configuration options 🔧 shows up where you can set line height, font size, font color and make your text **bold** or _italic_.
