2020 was a looooong and productive year for us. A lot of things happened with one common goal: to launch sensenet as a service (or SNaaS for short).

---

This year was dedicated for the preparation of SNaaS launch which has generated various tasks in different fields like marketing, sales and development. Fortunately we were mostly able to stick to our plans defined at the beggining of the year.
Below you can see our timeline for 2020 with the most important milestones and happenings.

# Q1
At the first quearter we started to define tasks and goals for the whole year. By the end of Q1 only one thing was sure: We wanted to launch SNaaS in BETA along with Hacktoberfest. This meant we had to have our new website up and running with fresh new content to promote the new model.
For that we wanted the help of a professional marketing agency. In addition to the website revamp, we asked their help to get new users for SNaaS. This part will happen in 2021 once we are ready to end BETA phase and launch the service.

# Q2
One of the most important task for this quarter was the content creation for the new site. We discussed a lot with the marketing agency to help them understand sensenet and the target audience of the new service. During this period we lived mostly in Microsoft Wor(l)d polishing our communication.

In the meantime our awesome Dev Op worked really hard under the hood to figure out how to run sensenet in a container (ANIKÃ“ PLS CLARIFY THIS SECTION) and planned the whole infrastructure along with the System Engineers.
