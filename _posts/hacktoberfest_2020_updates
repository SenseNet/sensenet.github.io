INTROOOOOO

---

As you may know the open-source community celebrates #hacktoberfest this month. sensenet also participates in this event by proposing limited edition socks as a reward for solving #hacktoberfest labeled issues on a dedicated [github board](https://github.com/orgs/SenseNet/projects/7).
 
To complete the challenge you have to register a free sensenet repository as a first ([see more details here](https://hacktoberfest.sensenet.com/#eventDetails)) and choose an issue from the [board](https://github.com/orgs/SenseNet/projects/7).
 
So far we have twentyish repo registration (which is quite good) but the progress on the [hacktoberfest board](https://github.com/orgs/SenseNet/projects/7) could be better.

So what kind of issues we prepared for this year's celebration?

Basically you have to write end to end tests in JavaScript for different test cases like breadcrumb feature or document viewer (you can see the full list on the dedicated [github board](https://github.com/orgs/SenseNet/projects/7)). For that we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (an all-in-one testing framework)
