At the end of 2020 we sat down to clarify our goals for the next year (both company and team level) and define the way to reach them. We came up with the idea to use OKR for that so we started to familiarize with the methodology and define objectives and key results for Q1.

# OKR in a nutshell??????????>#>#>&>&>#@>#{@@{{>&@{

"Objectives and Key Results (OKR) is a critical thinking framework and goal setting methodology that helps companies to align goals and ensure everyone is working collaboratively on goals that really matter." (source: weekdone.com)

We found that weekdone offers everything we need at the moment to start our journey. Since every department has a role in reaching the goals, we applied the methodology to the whole company including every team.

# Journey so far

We organized a kick-off meeting to define high-level goals then every team specified lower level objectives and key results. Fortunately righ after defining these objectives, we started to implement new processes in our day to day work, so for january 2021 we had some practice in this new framework and we got used to monitor the results every week.



OKR:
basics – valid for the whole company
Journey so far, preparation, start
Our plans for Q1 – weekly check-ups, modszertan
