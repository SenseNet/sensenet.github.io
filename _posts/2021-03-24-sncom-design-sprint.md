6 people, 4 days, ‚àû coffees and the result is 1 prototype and lot of feedbacks and new ideas by the end of the week. This was our design sprint in a nutshell.

## Roots

We launched our new website in October 2020 because we came out with our SaaS model (called sensenet as a service) currently in BETA. This new site with fresh content for the new era allowed us to lead visitors to register to the service. Back then we must to act fast since we wanted to get the whole thing ready for Hactoberfest, for this reason some processes was not detailed enough. Since last year we gathered some stats about the usage and interaction with our site and we thought that some thing can and should be improved.

## Goal

We have some early birds registered to the BETA but we still need more feedback in this phase so our goal is to convince more people to give SNaaS a try. Since this is a much bigger task to fit into a simple 1,5 hours meeting, a design sprint seemed as a perfect solution to accomplish this challenge. Our objective was to start from square one and go through the whole process and fine-tune the journey of a customer.

## Process

All of us rescheduled our meetings and cleaned up our agenda to focus only on this task. This was a virtual event (you know why) so everyone joined via Teams and worked in Miro which is perfect for this kind of collaboration. Thanks to our colleague üëèüèº everything was ready and prepared by the first morning so we just had to join and start working together.

In a design sprint (at least how we did it) there was some special roles. We had a Decider who makes the important decisions (with bigger voting power in each question), and a Facilitator who leads the the whole event.

We went through several phases of collecting ideas in a specific topic, voting and getting closer to our target and by Thursday, we had a prototype to user test on Friday with 5 enthusiastic volunteersüëè.

## Results

Feedbacks from the user interviews led us to identify some patterns and from that we were able to create a handful of tasks. We prioritized these and we already see that some of the topics will need additional design sprints and we are looking forward to do so since it's quite effective, inspiring and it changed our daily routine which all can lead to great results.ü•≥üéà‚≠ê
